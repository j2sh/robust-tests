# Robust Tests


* Refactor your code while passing tests
* High coverage + low coupling
* HTML is your only true API


# I do
* Post index
* Create form
* Write integration tests
* Check coverage w/ cover\_me

# We do
* add delete button and test
* refactor to use the file system to store posts
* don't change tests during refactor
* check coverage

# You do
* add sort by name / sort by date button with test
* refactor to use ajax to handle the sort (selenium driver)
* don't change the tests
* check coverage
